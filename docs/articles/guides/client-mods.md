# Client Mods

The framework comes with several modules. Some of these modules require some client mods to be present to take effect. In the `Client` folder you'll find two seperate folders:

* Raw - Contains all raw client mod files, that can be opened / edited with the _HogwartsLegacyCreatorKit_
* Cooked - Precooked client mods that you can use

## Installation

To install a client mod, you can copy the _Cooked_ versions (`*.pak` files) of that mod into your `HogWarp\Mods` folder.

## Cauldron

The _Cauldron_ is a tool, that helps to locally cook the client mods and compress them offering a nice user interface, so you don't have to use the CLI. It uses the `AutomationTool` and other scripts to aid the local cooking process.

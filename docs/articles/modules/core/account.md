# Account

Each player (based on their *DiscordID*) is granted an @Pillars.Entities.Account . Upon connect, the account is associated with the current player.

If you want to extend the account, e.g. add additional fields to the account, you can check out the [Database](../../advanced/database.md) documentation.
